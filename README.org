** Installation

   Until and unless MELPA is updated, configure your package manager (which
   should support pointing at specific repositories) to use this repo.

  #+begin_src elisp

    ;; using straight use-package with custom recipe
    (use-package command-log-mode
      :straight '(command-log-mode
                  :type git :host github :repo "positron-solutions/command-log-mode"))

    ;; using elpaca (recommended to add a hash for reproducibility)
    (elpaca-use-package
     (command-log-mode :host github
                         :repo "positron-solutions/command-log-mode"))

  #+end_src

** How do I use it?

   Use the =clm-toggle= command.  The use-package configuration below will
   configure this command to log globally, including the mininbuffer, and to
   disable the global minor mode when you toggle while the buffer is visible.
   Customize the =command-log= group for more options.

   #+begin_src elisp

     (use-package command-log-mode
        :custom
        (clm-window-text-scale 2 "Command log two steps higher text scale")
        (clm-logging-shows-buffer t "Toggling will show the buffer.")
        (clm-hiding-disables-logging t "Toggling visible buffer turns off logging.")
        (clm-disabling-logging-kills-buffer t "The buffer will be new when displayed again.")
        (clm-log-globally t "Auto-enable with global minor mode (including minibuffer)")
        (clm-exceptions '(self-insert-command) "Be chatty.
        Show everything besides self-insert-command"))

   #+end_src

   You can reveal all commands by running [M-x]
   =clm-toggle-show-all-commands=.

   Commands to toggle buffer showing and to turn everything off without doing it
   on every toggle are sorely needed.  PR's welcome!
