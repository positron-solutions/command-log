** What it look like?

   [[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode/raw/master/screenshot1.png]]

** How do I use it?

   Use the =clm-toggle= command.  The use-package configuration below will
   configure this command to log globally, including the mininbuffer, and to
   disable the global minor mode when you toggle while the buffer is visible.
   Customize the =command-log= group for more options.

   #+begin_src elisp

     (use-package command-log-mode
        :custom
        (clm-window-text-scale 2)
        (clm-open-log-turns-on-mode t "Show buffer enables mode")
        (clm-close-log-turns-off-mode t "Show buffer disables mode")
        (clm-log-globally "Auto-enable with global minor mode (including minibuffer)")
        (clm-log-command-exceptions '(self-insert-command) "Be chatty.
        Show everything besides self-insert-command"))

   #+end_src
