Please see the [[https://github.com/tarsius/keycast/tree/master][keycast]] and [[https://github.com/chuntaro/emacs-keypression][keypression]] package, which has options to display in
a posframe, headline, or modeline.  It's a pretty well written package.  This
package was forked to clean up the [[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode][command-log-mode]] package that is still
ranking highly in a lot of search results.

** What it do?

   Watch commands & key sequences in some or all buffers.  Good for recording
   demos or annotating videos.

   - Logs can be saved and contain command timestamps
   - Filter commands or activate logging only in select buffers
   - Side window buffer display

** What it look like?

** Installation

   Until and unless MELPA is updated, configure your package manager (which
   should support pointing at specific repositories) to use this repo.

  #+begin_src elisp
    ;; using elpaca (recommended to add a hash for reproducibility)
    (use-package
      :elpaca (command-log
               :host github
               :repo "positron-solutions/command-log"))

    ;; using straight use-package with custom recipe
    (use-package command-log
      :straight '(command-log
                  :type git :host github :repo "positron-solutions/command-log"))
  #+end_src

** How do I use it?

   Use the ~command-log-toggle~ command.  The use-package configuration below will
   configure this command to log globally, including the minibuffer, and to
   disable the global minor mode when you toggle while the buffer is visible.
   Customize the =command-log= group for more options.

   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package command-log
       :config
       (setopt command-log-filter-commands '(self-insert-command) ; commands you don't care about
       (setopt command-log-mouse t)
       (setopt command-log-text t) ; print strings rather than streams of `self-insert-command'.

       (setopt command-log-merge-repeats t) ; show repeat counts without making new entries
       ;; This following option and some related options can be powerful for
       ;; revealing how commands are delegating out to other commands, such as M-x
       ;; and ivy.  Read the docs ;-)
       (setopt command-log-merge-repeat-targets 'post-command)
   #+end_src

*** Unveiling More Details

   You can reveal all commands temporarily by running [M-x]
   ~command-log-toggle-show-all~.  It overrides several behaviors to try to reveal
   more.

   There is also ~command-log-tail-dribble~ if you need to see your inputs for
   debugging.  Don't forget about simple ~view-lossage~ and refreshing with =g=.

   Commands to toggle buffer showing and to turn everything off without doing it
   on every toggle are sorely needed.  PR's welcome!
