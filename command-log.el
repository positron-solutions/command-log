;;; Commentary:

;; This package is an updated fork of `command-log-mode'.  Also see the
;; `keycast' and `keypression' packages.

;; This add-on can be used to demo Emacs to an audience.  When activated,
;; keystrokes get logged into a designated buffer, along with the command bound
;; to them.

;; To enable, use e.g.:
;;
;; (require 'command-log)
;;
;; To see the log buffer, call M-x `command-log-toggle'.

;; The key strokes in the log are decorated with ISO9601 timestamps on the
;; property `:time' so if you want to convert the log for screencasting purposes
;; you could use the time stamp as a key into the video beginning.
